I feel very confident in my abilites with arrays as I've learned them so far.
I would like to look at more complex examples of arrays and see how they fit practically within a project. Its easy to understand things in their simpliest forms, I want to be prepared when applying to everything else that I've learned.
I so far have no questions. Any questions I did have, I was able to find online.
